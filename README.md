## 🔧 Development Challenges & Solutions

### Middleware Implementation Issue

**Challenge**: Encountered deployment errors on Vercel due to middleware implementation with Supabase.

**Solution**: Identified the use of a deprecated Supabase function in the middleware and updated to the latest API. This fixed the deployment issues and improved overall stability.

### Email Notification System

**Challenge**: Setting up reliable email notifications for form submissions.

**Solution**: Implemented Nodemailer with proper error handling and confirmation messages, ensuring users receive acknowledgment of their submissions.
